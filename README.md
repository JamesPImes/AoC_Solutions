# Advent of Code solutions

My solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) coding challenges. Most have not particularly cleaned or optimized.

`aoctools.py` is just a collection of a few functions I wrote to streamline loading puzzle input (`aoctools.puzzle_input`), test solutions against the provided sample data and answers (`aoctools.test`), and submit my solutions (`aoctools.submit`). They get used in most of the scripts but don't do any heavy lifting.
